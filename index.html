                <p>This picture was from this summer. I was wisiting my frineds in Tønsberg, one hour from where i live. 
                    We went to beach to have a couple of cold ones. On the left you see my friend Sander, he is currently a student at BI.
                    On the right you can see my frind Emil. He is a mechanic and is currently living in Tønsberg. Later this day we went
                    to a nice resturant on Tønsberg-pier. I will rate this day 10/10.

                    This was from the time i went to Besseggen. This is a really popular place for turists and adventurers to go.
                    At the time this picture was taken we where making our final steps up the mountain, but it was in return the most
                    sketchy part to climb. As you can see it's pretty steep behind us.

                    This is a picture taken at the start of the summervacation. I started the trip by cycling to Sandermosen-st. After that
                    i walked from Sandermosen to Barlindåsen. This is a picture of myself on the top, and you can see the a nice view in the background.

                    This is a picture I took at the top of Preikestolen(Preacher's Chair') last summer. The cliff is in Lysefjorden,
                    and it is 604 meter from the top to the bottom. It was a fun tripp, but it was a long walk from parkinglot to the top.

                    This is a picture of me when i where on a school trip last year. We went to Andøya. This is an island far up in
                    North of Norway. I recall it being extremly wind. The view was amazing and we learned a lot about the geographic
                    landscape that is prevelant in north of Norway.

                    This is a picture i took myself from my time at Andøya. As you can see the scenery is wonderful. from where we stood
                    you have a 180° view of the open waters with majestic peeks on our left and right. 10/10 trip would recomend everyone
                    go here one day.
