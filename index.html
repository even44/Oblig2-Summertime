                <p>This picture was from this summer. I was visiting my friends in Tønsberg, one hour from where I live. We went to beach to 
                    have a couple of cold ones. On the left you see my friend Sander; he is currently a student at BI. On the right you can 
                    see my friend Emil. He is a mechanic and is currently living in Tønsberg. Later this day we went to a nice restaurant on 
                    Tønsberg-pier. I will rate this day 10/10.

                    This was from the time i went to Besseggen. This is a popular place for turists and adventurers to go.
                    At the time this picture was taken we were making our final steps up the mountain, but it was in return the most
                    sketchy part to climb. As you can see it's steep behind us.

                    This is a picture taken at the start of the summervacation. I started the trip by cycling to Sandermosen-st. After that
                    i walked from Sandermosen to Barlindåsen. This is a picture of myself on the top, and you can see the a nice view in the background.

                    This is a picture I took at the top of Preikestolen(Preacher's Chair') last summer. The cliff is in Lysefjorden,
                    and it is 604 meter from the top to the bottom. It was a fun tripp, but it was a long walk from parkinglot to the top.

                    This is a picture of me when I was on a school trip last year. We went to Andøya. This is an island far up in the North of Norway. 
                    I recall it being extremely windy. 
                    The view was amazing and we learned a lot about the geographic landscape that is prevalent in the north of Norway.

                    This is a picture I took myself from my time at Andøya. As you can see the scenery is wonderful. 
                    From where we stood you have a 180° view of the open waters with majestic peeks on our left and right. 
                    10/10 trip would recommend everyone to go here one day.
