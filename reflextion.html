            We started by discussing how we wanted the page to look. We originally wanted the desktop interface to be a 
            3x2 grid of pictures where we add text under the pictures describing something about the context around the 
            picture. What we found out was that always having a 3x2 grid would force us to have the pictures small for 
            some screen sizes and big for others. Therefore, we did some research and learned about the display: grid. 
            This let us make the grid responsive by changing the picture size based on how much space there was, but with 
            a limit, making the pictures wrap around instead of being tiny. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, we have a "desktop.CSS" and "mobile.CSS" that is almost identical, and the only things we changed are 
            the letter sizes and the threshold for wrapping the pictures 
        </p>

        <p>
            We first thought about having a picture of a sun in the background. We wanted it to be a pattern with a 
            repeating picture of a sun. After a time, we changed the idea, and wanted to have a background that was changing 
            colours. We used @keyframes to change the colour of the background and chose colours that we associate with summer. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We also used the picture element with srcset in all our pictures. This made it possible to spice up the webpage 
            by having different pictures according to the screen size. If you view picture one in pc format you will see a 
            different picture from when you see it in mobile format. This is true for all other pictures as well. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Making this page was a difficult task as we had to learn some new features. Making the background with changing 
            colours forced us to get a better understanding of key-frames. We had not previously used either srcset or pictures 
            elements before but with this assignment we got to delve into these features. 
        </p>

            In our other projects we have usualy have a made the navigation as a bar on the top with links to the different pages.
            In this project we wanted to do something different and have this navigation in the footer of the page. We thought this
            looked nice.
